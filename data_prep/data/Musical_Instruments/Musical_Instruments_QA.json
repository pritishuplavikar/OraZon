Don't sweat it, with a little patience you can make this cheapie mandolin sound pretty darn good. By design these mandolins don't come setup right out of the box - thats probably why they are so cheap. It's tough to say without actually seeing and hearing the problem, but based on your description (thumping, dead, kind of plucky top G) I would have to assume something is wrong with the nut, bridge, or tailpiece. The nut is the white (in your case plastic) piece where the headstock meets the fretboard. Check out the grooves in which the strings sit - if the offending string seems higher or deeper in a groove, thats your problem. If it sits too high (which is what I suspect) take a very thin file, the thickness of the string if you have it, and incrementally remove material from the groove until the string rings true. If it sits too low, you'll need to add material, which can be tricky. I've never done it personally, but I believe if you make a mix of plastic (file shavings - powder) and superglue, it should act as a quick fix to fill the nut, then file it down as needed. If thats not the case, look at the bridge - make sure the strings are in the precut designated grooves of the bridge, and the bridge height is uniform across all of the strings, the bridge is not angled, and lies straight across the top. Lastly, just take the metal tailpiece off and try playing. Sometimes the metal of the tailpiece actually touches the strings and makes them buzz - or worse mutes them. Some mandolinists just chuck the tailpiece, but I prefer to add a piece of cloth or leather where the strings meet the metal. Regardless of the issue, I recommend switching out the Rouge stock strings. I use these on all my mandolins: http://www.amazon.com/DAddario-J74-Mandolin-Strings-Phosphor/dp/B000EEHMXA But strings are a matter of personal preference, so take that with a grain of salt As you might be able to infer, a lot can go wrong with a mandolin setup, such is the curse of floating bridge instruments. If you find yourself stuck down in the weeds, Rob Meldrum put together a free ebook. Just email him asking about mandolin setup and he'll send it to you for free: rob.meldrum@gmail.com If you aren't comfortable toying with the setup, or just don't have the time, go to your local music shop and ask for a setup. They should be able to take care of all of this for you for about $40ish bucks Shoot me another note if you have further questions, this stuff can get a little confusing.

These pins give even a coated string incredible sound.(that is the response of people who hear the guitar without me even asking). The cons. They fit a lot of guitars loosely.

Warning: If you use an AT2020 USB, it will eat up your battery life, you NEED to have your machine plugged in to use it for a long duration. Reason is: the mic takes about 40 volts of power and audio recording and engineering is a processor intensive task (more CPU work = more power being consumed), it also takes a lot of memory so your HDD will be running non stop.

I would have to guess no.", "asin": "B000LQLDM2", "answerType": "N", "question": "will it fit yeti pro mic?"}, {"answer": "It will not, as received. If you are mechanically inclined, remove the mic locking bushing from bottom of shock mount by carefully prying it out from the bottom using a flat blade screwdriver. (Do not try to remove the bushing from MXL stand mount). Then obtain two rubber \"O\" rings about 7/8\" inside diameter with 1/8\" thickness. Stretch them, one at a time, onto the outside of bushing removed from bottom of shock mount. This acts as a spacer to take up slack when screwed onto 550. Put the 550 into mount and carefully screw the bushing (lock nut) onto mic and snug it up till mic is secure. The \"O\" rings should be on the outside of shock mount bottom. Be careful not to cross thread when starting to screw it on. Another way would be to put bushing through hole in bottom of mount and hold it whilst turning mic until snug. Don't forget to remove the thread adapter from stand fitting if you are using it with U.S. 5/8\" stands. Works well for me.", "asin": "B000LQLDM2", "answerType": "?", "question": "Will this mount accommodate an MXL 550?"}, {"answer": "Yes & No. Right out of the box they are not compatible. However, if you are moderately mechanically inclined, a simple operation will allow them to work perfectly, without having to buy a shock mount with that ugly squeeze clamp that fits around the body and may cost more as well. You will need a quality flat blade screw driver about 1/4\" wide and on the thin side. I used the large flat one from a Leatherman Tool. You have to remove the Samson threaded mic attachment collar using a flat blade screwdriver to pry it from bottom of shock mount, working around and prying it out. Kind of like prying the lid off a paint can. There is a circular metal ring in a groove inside that keeps it from falling out. I have removed the Samson collar from bottom of several SP01's and use them with various mic's that come with a fixed stand mount. Such as, MXL , AKG Perception 100, and Groove Tube GT M11. Depending on the particular mic, you may need to use one or two approx. 13/16\" I.D. X 1/8\" thick O'rings as spacers with the screw on collar. If you can't get O' rings, you will need to do the same operation with the 550 stand adapter to liberate the screw on collar. The stand mount is plastic and will crack a piece around the hole when you pry out the metal collar. This does not keep you from using it if you want to, it's just that the screw collar will be separate and can be used with the SPO1 or the fixed stand adapter. It fits the 550 just right and works very well. Always be careful not to cross thread when attaching mike to stand adapter, like you would when attaching to a mike stand. If it doesn't turn freely, don't force it! Back it up until you feel the threads connect then gently screw it on and snug it up.

Any string will do and the Ernie Ball Regulars are an excellent choice. But, Intonation is the issue when you are dealing with any scale length. Don't want the string too forward or too back. Want it in the Sweet Spot for the best tone.

The DR-40 cannot mount to the bottom. My suggestion is to try the DR-60, which I also own, which could then be mounted to a tripod. There are two ways to introduce audio to video, either by directly feeding into the camera using either the internal mic, plugging in an external mic, plugging an external mic to a digital recorder then plugging in to the camera, or by using video software and syncing on a computer. You don't sync at time of recording since it is in real time. It is why a clapperboard is used if you are using a digital recorder and the internal mic at the same time. At the time of editing, you line up the audio spikes from both the internal mic and the auxiliary audio tracks and then mute the internal mic track. That is simplifying the way you sync audio. I might suggest getting the DR-60 instead since it also has an headphone jack out which allows you to listen in real-time to the audio. Personally, I prefer to capture audio as much as I can by using a Rhode mic plugged into the camera, then another mic plugged into the DR-60.
