## OraZon - an Oracle for Amazon

E-commerce websites like Amazon have millions of products for sale. For answering queries
about any product, there is a separate question answer section. However, most of the products
either don’t have this section at all or sometimes fail to answer all the user queries. In such
cases, the user has to go through many product reviews to be sure that the product satisfies all
his requirements, before making the purchase. For a popular product on Amazon, the number
of reviews can be exceptionally huge. The user may be required to spend a lot of time going
through these huge number of queries before finding relevant reviews and when the user is comparing
multiple products the case is even more worse.

Our tool OraZon tries to solve this problem by analyzing all the product reviews and suggesting
top 5 reviews which will answer the user query. We will also generate an answer to the
user query using all the top reviews.

With our tool, the time spent by the user in making the the product purchase decision can
be dramatically reduced. Also, suggesting the top product reviews can help make the user a
more informed purchase decision.
