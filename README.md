## OraZon - an Oracle for Amazon

E-commerce websites like Amazon have millions of products for sale. For answering queries
about any product, there is a separate question answer section. However, most of the products
either donâ€™t have this section at all or sometimes fail to answer all the user queries. In such
cases, the user has to go through many product reviews to be sure that the product satisfies all
his requirements, before making the purchase. For a popular product on Amazon, the number
of reviews can be exceptionally huge. The user may be required to spend a lot of time going
through these huge number of queries before finding relevant reviews and when the user is comparing
multiple products the case is even more worse.

Our tool OraZon tries to solve this problem by analyzing all the product reviews and suggesting
top 5 reviews which are most relevant to the user query. We are additionally finding top relevant sentences to the user query. As relevant sentences can have both positive and negative opinion polarity, we are generating two answers from top 5 sentences of both the polarities. 

With our tool in place, we plan to reduce the time spent by the user in making the the product purchase decision. Also, suggesting the top product reviews along with two automatically generated answers of different opinion polarities can help the user make a more informed purchase decision.
